			<p>It is an ancient Mariner,<br>
				And he stoppeth one of three.<br>
				'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br>
				Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?<br>
				<br>
				The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,<br>
				And I am next of kin;<br>
				The guests are met, the feast is set:<br>
				May'st hear the merry din.'<br><br>

				He holds him with his skinny hand,<br>
				'There was a ship,' quoth he.<br>
				'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'<br>
				Eftsoons his hand dropt he.<br><br>

				He holds him with his glittering eyeâ€”<br>
				The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br>
				And listens like a three years' child:<br>
				The Mariner hath his will.<br><br>

				The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:<br><br>
				He cannot choose but hear;<br>
				And thus spake on that ancient man,<br>
				The bright-eyed Mariner.
				<br><br>
				'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br>
				Merrily did we drop<br>
				Below the kirk, below the hill,<br><br>
				Below the lighthouse top.<br>

				The Sun came up upon the left,<br>
				Out of the sea came he!
				And he shone bright, and on the right<br>
				Went down into the sea.
